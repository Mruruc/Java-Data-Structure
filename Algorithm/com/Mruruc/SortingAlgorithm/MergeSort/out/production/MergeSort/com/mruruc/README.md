## Merge Sort

**Merge Sort** is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that
recursively divides an array into two halves, 
sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.
It's a stable sort and works well for large data sets.

### Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n*log(n))
- Average Case: O(n*log(n))
- Worst Case: O(n*log(n))

### Space Complexity
- O(n) due to the additional temporary arrays used during the merging process.
