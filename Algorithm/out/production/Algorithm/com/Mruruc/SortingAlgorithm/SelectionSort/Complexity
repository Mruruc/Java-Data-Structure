Time complexity: If the input array has n elements,
the selectionSort method will take roughly n^2 iterations to sort the array.
For example, if the input array has 10 elements, the method will take around 100 iterations to sort the array.
As the size of the input array grows,
the number of iterations will increase quadratically, making the method slower and slower.(O(n^2))

Space complexity: The selectionSort method uses a constant amount of extra memory to store temporary variables,
such as the indices of the maximum and last elements. Regardless of the size of the input array,
the method will always use the same amount of memory, making its space complexity constant.(O(1))
