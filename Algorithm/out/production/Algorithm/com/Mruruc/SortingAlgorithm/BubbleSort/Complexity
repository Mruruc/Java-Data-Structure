The time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm in the worst-case scenario
(when the input array is in reverse order) is O(n^2),
 where n is the number of elements in the array.

In the worst-case scenario, the outer loop runs n times, and for each iteration of the outer loop,
the inner loop performs n-i comparisons. Therefore, the total number of comparisons is:

n-1 + n-2 + n-3 + ... + 2 + 1

This is an arithmetic series, and the sum can be computed as:

(n-1 + 1) * (n-1) / 2 = n * (n-1) / 2

Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2).
