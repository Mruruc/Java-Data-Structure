# Stack Data Structure

A stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order for the operations.
The order known as LIFO(First In Last Out). This means the last element added to the stack will be the first one removed.

## Main Operations
- Push: Add an element on top of the stack.
- Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.
- Peek: get the value of the top element without removing it.

### Characteristics
- Dynamic or Static: Stacks can be implemented in a dynamic form (using linked lists) or a static form (using arrays).
- Access: Elements can only be accessed, inserted, or removed from the top of the stack.

### Use Cases
- Expression Evaluation: Parsing expressions in compilers.
- Backtracking: Depth-First Search (DFS) in algorithms.
- Function Call Management: Managing function calls in programming languages (call stack).
- Undo Mechanism: Implementing undo functionality in text editors.
- Syntax Parsing: Checking for balanced parentheses.
